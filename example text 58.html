        <h1>The Story in the book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about   
        an hour now. On her desk, Lying betweeen the copies
        of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>. and all
        the other Scientist journals her work had
        appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
        The road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
        since college, and the longer she spent in these
        four walls the more she felt she needed to be
        free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in the room,
        sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
        proclaiminf that <q>Work is the refuge of
        people who have nothing better to do.</q> Although
        many considrered her pioneering work, unraveling
        the secrets of the llama <abbr
        title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">Dna</abbr>, to be an
        outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
        she had something better to do.</p>
